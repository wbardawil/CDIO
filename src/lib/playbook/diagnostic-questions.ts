// ============================================================
// AI-CDIO — Diagnostic Questions
//
// PLAYBOOK-GROUNDED REWRITE (2026-05-09).
//
// Every question in this file is a verbatim diagnostic question
// from the AI-CDIO source playbook (`source-playbook/`), specifically
// from `01_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` Section "MODULE ASSESSMENTS".
// Each question is paired with the playbook's verbatim Level 1-4
// maturity descriptions for the same module.
//
// Provenance per question (required field) records: source file,
// section, subcategory, and which fields are verbatim playbook
// content vs which are AI-CDIO extensions on top.
//
// AI-CDIO extensions (clearly marked in provenance):
//   - level_indicators.level_5  — "Optimizing" tier extending
//     the playbook's Level 4 "Advanced". Module-wide rather
//     than per-question.
//   - tags.function / tags.area — role-filter tagging used by
//     `filterQuestionsForRole()` so a CEO doesn't see questions
//     a CTO is better-positioned to answer. Inferred from
//     question content; not in the playbook.
//   - framework_citation        — points back to the playbook
//     section (and any external framework reference the
//     playbook explicitly cites).
//   - na_eligible (default true) — every question can be marked
//     N/A by the respondent.
//
// Replaces the 90-question strict cut (commit aa8e42a). The cut
// removed AI-CDIO interpolation but kept some external-framework
// synthesis. The playbook supersedes that synthesis: this file
// is the canonical, grounded question bank.
